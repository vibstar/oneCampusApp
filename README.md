# oneCampusApp

The name of this app is One Campus
This is just a temporary name while I work on a final one

The goal of this app is to replace all the apps that colleges have us download. At Brandeis there are several apps and webpages that we have to use in our daily lives, including but not limited to: Get, BiteU, Branda, and the Covid passport. The end goal of this app is to have the functionalities of all the aforementioned services and then some, all in just one app. This isn't exactly a necessity but it will be a good quality of life change for the thousands of students on the Brandeis campus.

I am using Stack Navigation to move from page to page. I use a Flat list to show the food menu. I use AsynchStorage for the login page
and storing the username. I also use the ScrollView tag for making the main menu scrollable on the home page and that adds funcitonality
for the future to add more navigabable pages from there.
