# oneCampusApp

The name of this app is One Campus
This is just a temporary name while I work on a final one

The goal of this app is to replace all the apps that colleges have us download. At Brandeis there are several apps and webpages that
we have to use in our daily lives, inlcuding but not limited to: Get, BiteU, Branda, and the Covid passport. The end goal of this app is
to have the functionalities of all the aformentioned services and then some, all in just one app. This isn't exactly a necessity but it
will be a good quality of life change for the thousands of students on the Brandeis campus.
